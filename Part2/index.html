  Hint: write the function in question (b, c, d) outside the Player scope 
<br><br>
  Note : do not use (for, while, recursion) but you allowed to use the High order function
    like (.map, .each, .filter, .reduce,.....) if you don't know how to use it just Google it 
 <br><br>
 today we will create a football team using what we learn,
<br><br>
 	a - we need to create the players using OOP the player declaration
    should take the name of the player  	==> var player1 = Player("jony")
<br><br>
  b - after that we need function to add the other info for the player with addInfo function
		==> player1.addInfo(age, position, level, availability );
<br><br>
	c- and create another function to increase the the level for the player by n value 
		==> player1.increaseLevel(4); 
<br><br>
	d - we need another function to check if the player is available or not it should return true or false
		==> player1.isAvailable();  true / false
<br><br>
	e - then we need to create 4 players and add the info for them and put them inside the arrayOfPlayers
<br><br>
	f - write function to iterate over the all players to decrease the level for the player if age larger the 30
<br><br>
  g - sort the players in the arrayOfPlayers by the key
		sortPalyerBy(arrayOfPlayers, "age");
		sortPalyerBy(arrayOfPlayers, "name");
